This is a full stack web application project which I made as a part of my college curriculum.
Summary of the Volunteer Management System Project:

The Volunteer Management System is a web application designed to facilitate efficient management and coordination of volunteers and their activities. It provides a platform for volunteers, coordinators, and administrators to interact and collaborate, enhancing the overall volunteering experience.

Key Features:
1. User Registration and Login: Volunteers can register for the system and log in with their credentials, enabling personalized access to features.

2. Volunteer Profile: Each volunteer has a profile containing personal information, contact details, and enrolled programs.

3. Dashboard: The admin dashboard displays essential metrics, such as the number of volunteers, hours spent, and lives impacted, providing valuable insights.

4. Programs and Activities: Volunteers can enroll in various programs and activities, keeping them engaged and informed about upcoming events.

5. Announcements: Administrators can post announcements to keep volunteers updated about important information and events.

6. Verification Process: Admins have the ability to review and verify posts submitted by volunteers before they are publicly displayed.

7. Verified Posts: After verification, posts are categorized as verified and displayed on the app to showcase volunteer achievements and contributions.

8. Activity Updates: Volunteers can submit activity updates, providing details about their participation and contributions to specific programs.

9. Image Upload: Volunteers can upload their profile pictures, adding a personal touch to their profiles.

10. Responsive Design: The app utilizes Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing design, ensuring seamless user experience across devices.

Overall, the Volunteer Management System empowers organizations to streamline volunteer management, track progress, and foster a sense of community among volunteers. It enhances communication, transparency, and collaboration, making it a valuable tool for any organization reliant on volunteers for their initiatives.
